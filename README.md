# Project EZ Search
EZ Search by David Garcia, Casey Myers, and Chase Thompson

## Description
EZ Search is designed so the consumer/visitor can come type in a topic in the search bar and receive the most recent information on said topic in a card & column styled format. Then the topic is displayed in a news-paper styled format and it is designed to summarize the topic in 5 maximum sentences. When clicking the button "Search Again" it puts another article of the topic into another one of the card columns and you can continue doing this up to 10x but you may search infinite topics up to 10x. Once you've reached your 10th URL you will be prompted with an error modal which displays it asking you to type a new topic in the search bar. There is a option to clear what has been searched (local storage) so you can begin a new search. If you decide to refresh the page, your previous topics that you searched will still display but note that the search again will not function properly so you will need to type in a new topic.
